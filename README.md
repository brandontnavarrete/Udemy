ðŸš€ Artificial Customer Transaction Data Generator (Completed)

Welcome to the Artificial Customer Transaction Data Generator project! This repository showcases the culmination of my efforts in generating artificial data that simulates customer bank transactions. The primary goal of this project was to gain experience implementing the `Faker` and `Schedule` libraries while creating a realistic and diverse dataset. ðŸŒŸ

  <summary>ðŸ“š Project Description</summary>

The aim of this project was to develop a data generation tool that simulates customer bank transactions. By leveraging the `Faker` library, I aimed to replicate realistic customer profiles with synthetic transaction data. Additionally, I utilized the `Schedule` library to automate the process of generating data and visualizing it on a daily basis.

  <summary>ðŸ§  Key Objectives</summary>

During the course of this project, I accomplished the following objectives:
- Developed an automated data generation function that produces simulated customer bank transactions.
- Implemented the `Schedule` library to schedule the daily execution of the data generation process.
- Created diverse visualizations, such as line plots and count plots, using both `matplotlib` and `plotly`.

  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Next Steps</summary>

Moving forward, I have identified the following areas for future enhancement and development:
-  Seek or create a more diverse dataset to enhance the realism of the generated data.
-  Implement an automated anomaly detection process to identify potential issues or outliers in the generated data.
-  Enhance the visualization capabilities to provide more insightful and interactive visual representations of customer transaction data.
-  Develop a warning or notification system to alert stakeholders about any detected anomalies or unusual patterns in the data.
