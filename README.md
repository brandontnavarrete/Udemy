- Built a diverse set of powerful Machine Learning models and learned how to combine them to solve any problem effectively.

## Course Structure

This course was structured to be flexible, allowing me to choose my own learning path. It was divided into ten parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of Machine Learning:

- Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
- Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
- Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
- Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
- Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
- Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
- Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
- Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
- Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
- Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost

Each section within each part was independent, allowing me to focus on specific topics that aligned with my interests and goals. Whether following the course sequentially or diving into specific sections, I was able to tailor my learning experience.

## Practical Approach and Hands-on Practice

To ensure an engaging learning experience, this course included practical exercises based on real-life case studies. By working on these exercises, I not only gained theoretical knowledge but also acquired valuable hands-on experience in building my own Machine Learning models.

As a bonus, I provided both Python and R code templates for download. These templates can be used in personal projects, saving time and effort in implementing various Machine Learning algorithms.
